# TV Script Generator(Recurrent Neural Network)

## Project Overview

This is a Recurrent Neural Network project for the Deep Learning course at Udacity. In this project, I used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network I built generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Project Instructions

### Getting the project files

1. The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. 
You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

```
  git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git

```

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.

	```
		jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
	```
  
  
 ## Project Information
 
 ### Architechture
 
 1. The project employs an embedding layer, a LSTM layer and a fully connected layer.
 
 ### Accelerating the Training Proecess
  
  In the training step switch to running the code on a GPU.
